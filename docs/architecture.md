# Architecture (DRAFT — needs love)

> This file was started a while ago and hasn't been kept up to date.
> Treat as partial. Update what you change.

## Modules

- **`server.ts`** — Express bootstrapper. Wires routers to paths.
- **`db.ts`** — SQLite connection + schema init. Single shared `db` instance.
- **`auth.ts`** — request authentication. Today: trusts `X-Merchant-Id` header.
  Eventually this becomes a real signed token; the header shape is a placeholder.
- **`dal/`** — data-access layer. The intent is that all order queries route
  through `ordersDal` so we have one place to add auditing, caching, tenancy
  filters, etc. (Not all routes follow this yet — see `metrics.ts`.)
- **`routes/`** — Express routers, one file per resource.
- **`lib/`** — utilities. Empty at the moment but reserved for shared helpers.

## Data model

Two tables: `merchants`, `orders`. See `db.ts` for the canonical DDL.

`orders.type` is one of `'sale' | 'refund'`. A refund row records that a sale
was reversed; it does not by itself reverse the sale row.

## Open items

- ~~Wire `dashboard.tsx` once we pick a frontend framework~~ — went with static HTML+fetch instead. Doc stale.
- Decide whether `analytics-events` is its own service or a route here.
- Audit logging — TBD where it lives.
